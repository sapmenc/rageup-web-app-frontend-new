              These Terms of Use for Rageup.in Services contained hereinafter
              ("TERMS OF USE") shall be in addition to the Terms & Conditions
              available on any other linked pages, products, software(s), API
              keys, features, content or application services (including but
              without limitation to any mobile application services) in
              connection therewith, offered from time to time by M/s Rageup
              ("RAGEUP" or "WE" or "OUR" or "US") (collectively, "WEBSITE").
              <br />
              Any person availing the Services of RageUp ("SERVICES") shall be
              presumed to have read these Terms of Use (which includes the
              Privacy Policy and Refund Policy, separately provided on the
              Website) and unconditionally accepted the terms and conditions set
              out herein. These Terms of Use constitute a binding and
              enforceable agreement between the User and RageUp. These Terms of
              Use do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other
              written agreement you may have with RageUp for other services.
              <br />
              Please read the terms set out hereunder carefully before agreeing
              to the same. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use (including
              any referenced policies or guidelines), please immediately
              terminate your use of the Website. You can accept the Terms of Use
              by:
              <br />
              Clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use, where this option
              is made available to you by RageUp in the User interface for any
              particular Service; or
              <br />
              Accessing, testing or actually using the Services. In this case,
              you understand and agree that RageUp will treat your use of the
              Services as acceptance of the Terms of Use from that point
              onwards.
              <br />
              For the purpose of these Terms of Use, wherever the context so
              requires, the term "USER" shall mean and include any natural or
              legal person who has agreed to these Terms of Use on behalf of
              itself or any other legal entity.

              It is clarified that the Privacy Policy and Refund Policy (that is

              Illegality or unenforceability of one or more provisions of these
              Terms of Use shall not affect the legality and enforceability of
              the other terms of the Terms of Use. For avoidance of doubt, if
              any of the provisions becomes void or unenforceable, the rest of
              the provisions of these Terms of Use shall be binding upon the
              User.
              <br />
              The Terms of Use may be revised or altered by us at our sole

              specific jurisdiction that may be applicable to you in connection
