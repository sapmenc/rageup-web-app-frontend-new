              1. Website Visitors
              <br />
              Like most website operators, RageUp collects
              non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
              browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
              type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
              of each visitor request. RageUp's purpose in collecting
              non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
              RageUp's visitors use its website. From time to time, RageUp may
              release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
              e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
              website. RageUp also collects potentially personally-identifying
              information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
              users and for users leaving comments on http://www.RageUp.in/ blog
              posts. RageUp only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
              addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
              personally-identifying information as described below.
              <br />
              2. Personally-Identifying Information
              <br />
              Certain visitors to RageUp's websites choose to interact with
              RageUp in ways that require RageUp to gather
              personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
              information that RageUp gathers depends on the nature of the
              interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at
              http://www.RageUp.in/ to provide a username and email address.
              <br />
              3. Security
              <br />
              The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
              remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or
              method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to
              use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal
              Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security
              <br />
              4. Links to External Sites
              <br />
              Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not
              operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be
              directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to
              review the Privacy Policy and terms of service of every site you
              visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for
              the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party
              sites, products or services.
              <br />
              5. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
              <br />
              RageUp discloses potentially personally-identifying information
              only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated
              organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
              process it on RageUp's behalf or to provide services available at
              RageUp's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
              others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
              organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
              using RageUp's website, you consent to the transfer of such
              information to them. RageUp will not rent or sell potentially
              personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
              employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
              above, RageUp discloses potentially personally identifying
              information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
              governmental request, or when RageUp believes in good faith that
              disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
              rights of RageUp, third parties or the public at large. If you are
              a registered user of http://www.RageUp.in/ and have supplied your
              email address, RageUp may occasionally send you an email to tell
              you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up
              to date with what's going on with RageUp and our products. We
              primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so
              we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us
              a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
              feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order
              to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
              support other users. RageUp takes all measures reasonably
              necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
              alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
              information.
              <br />
              6. Cookies
              <br />
              To enrich and perfect your online experience, RageUp uses
              "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to
              display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store
              your preferences on your computer. A cookie is a string of
              information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and
              that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the
              visitor returns. RageUp uses cookies to help RageUp identify and
              track visitors, their usage of http://www.RageUp.in/, and their
              website access preferences. RageUp visitors who do not wish to
              have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers
              to refuse cookies before using RageUp's websites, with the
              drawback that certain features of RageUp's websites may not
              function properly without the aid of cookies. By continuing to
              navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you
              hereby acknowledge and agree to RageUp's use of cookies.
              <br />
              7. E-commerce
              <br />
              Those who engage in transactions with RageUp – by purchasing
              RageUp's services or products, are asked to provide additional
              information, including as necessary the personal and financial
              information required to process those transactions. In each case,
              RageUp collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
              appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction
              with RageUp. RageUp does not disclose personally-identifying
              information other than as described below. And visitors can always
              refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the
              caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
              website-related activities.
              <br />
              8. Privacy Policy Changes
              <br />
              Although most changes are likely to be minor, RageUp may change
              its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in RageUp's sole
              discretion. RageUp encourages visitors to frequently check this
              page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of
              this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute
              your acceptance of such change.
              <br />
